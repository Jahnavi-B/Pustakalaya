“Pustakalaya: Library Database Management System”

Good Books enrich our mind with good thoughts and knowledge just like a good friend. We cannot feel alone in the company of books. We can learn many good things while reading a good book. Books written by famous and experienced people helps us to become a better human being and also teach us how to serve the society in the best possible way. Books can either be referred to and studied from to attain knowledge in one’s profession or they can be read for leisure to ease one’s state of mind.

Often, it becomes a problem to organize the existing e-books and to categorize them. My stand-alone application, “Pustakalaya: A Library Database Management System,” organizes information of books stored. An admin has the main authority who can do addition, deletion and modification of the Pustakalaya if required. More than one admins can be added.
